Question No 2 is done in React.
I have tried to make a react app.
I started the project by writing npx create-react-aap react-todo in the terminal of my project.
Then when the packages were installed I have written the following commands : cd react-todo, npm start.
The web application will run on Local:            http://localhost:3000 
There are several issues in my application and it is not running but I have tried my best to complete the tast as I have made this app in react for the first time.
